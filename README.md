# Azure-Data-Architecture
This is the Microsoft Azure Architecture that I would run end-to-end as an Azure Data [Analytics] Engineer. In this architecture, data is extracted from the datasource, transformed to clean and make sense of the data, and loaded into a new platform for end-user consumption. This data can either be batched or streamed. All while maintaining data governance, security and SRE in Microsoft Azure.
